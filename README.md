# ChatBot
-Rule based chatbot coded in python 3

-This is project is currently in progress and code will be updated in real time

-As I learn more about machine learning and AI, I will be gradually adding more learning based functions to the bot

-There are numerous files to go along with this project. The backend will be coded in base Python, using some libraries such as random and re

-The frontend will be coded with either pyscript or dash

-The user database will be ran on either mySQL or Microsoft SQL. This part allows each user to be identified and have chat logs saved. This will increase the bots accuracy as we will have previous information stored behind a username and password.

-Financial based forums will be scraped, parsed and placed into a database for machine learning and training purposes.

(Backend is currently being worked on, I will update this section once I move on to different sections)
