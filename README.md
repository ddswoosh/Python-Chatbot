# ChatBot
Rule based chatbot coded in python 3. This is project is currently in progress and code will be updated in real time

As I learn more about machine learning and AI, I will be gradually adding more learning based functions to the bot. There are numerous files to go along with this project as it is a full stack application

The backend is coded in python using some libraries. To allow an executable frontend, we will be using pyscript to link our backend. A restful API will be created for authentication purposes where username and password will be stored as a key value pair with a unique ID as the primary key. This key will be linked as a foreign key in another table that will store the users personal variables such as credit score, debts, etc. The databse will be hosted using Microsoft SQL Server.
  
Natural language processing will be rolled out later into the project

Financial based forums will be scraped, parsed and placed into the database for machine learning and training purposes.
